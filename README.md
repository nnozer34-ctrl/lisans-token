# 🚀 Stellar Licensing System (LNS Tokenized Access)

## 🎯 1. Project Overview and Vision

This project is a secure and scalable decentralized access application (dApp) combining AI-ready infrastructure with Stellar's Soroban smart contract platform. It moves access control away from server dependence, entrusting the decision to immutable Blockchain Rules.

* Goal: To link access to website content with the ownership of an LNS (License Token) held in the user's wallet.
* Technologies: Soroban (Rust), Stellar, Node.js, Freighter.

## ✨ 2. Core Features

| Category | Technology | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 🔗 Soroban Contracts | Rust/Soroban SDK | Implements the core logic for License Token management (mint_license) and access verification (check_access). |
| 🤖 AI/Backend Readiness| Node.js / Python API | Backend architecture prepared for future AI decision-making and data processing modules. |
| 🌐 Web3 Frontend | React / Vite | Modern interface, instant token query, and transaction submission capability. |
| 💰 Low Cost | Stellar | Highly scalable micro-licensing due to very low transaction fees. |
| 📱 Cüzdan Entegrasyonu | Freighter API | Enables users to securely sign transactions without sharing their Secret Key. |
